# Understand Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

A data lake is a repository of data that is stored in its natural format, usually as blobs or files. Azure Data Lake Storage is a comprehensive, massively scalable, secure, and cost-effective data lake solution for high performance analytics built into Azure.
Azure Data Lake Storage combines a file system with a storage platform to help you quickly identify insights into your data. Data Lake Storage builds on Azure Blob storage capabilities to optimize it specifically for analytics workloads. This integration enables analytics performance, the tiering and data lifecycle management capabilities of Blob storage, and the high-availability, security, and durability capabilities of Azure Storage.
