# What is DBMS ? 

A database is a collection of interrelated data that helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. For Example, a university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc. which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from it.

- **Data Organization**: Efficiently stores, manages, and organizes large amounts of data.
- **Data Security**: Protects data from unauthorized access and ensures privacy.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains accuracy and consistency of data across transactions.
- **Data Redundancy Reduction**: Minimizes duplication of data by centralized storage.
- **Concurrent Access**: Supports multiple users accessing data simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Ensures data is safely backed up and can be restored in case of failure.
- **Query Optimization**: Provides efficient data retrieval through optimized queries.
- **Data Independence**: Separates data structure from application logic, allowing flexibility in data manipulation.
