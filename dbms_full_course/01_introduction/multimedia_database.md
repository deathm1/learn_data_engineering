# Multimedia Database

- **Multimedia Database**: Collection of interrelated multimedia data like text, images, graphics, audio, video, etc.
- **Multimedia DBMS**: Manages different types of multimedia data, stored and delivered in various ways.

### Classes of Multimedia Data:

1. **Static Media**: Text, images, etc.
2. **Dynamic Media**: Video, audio, etc.
3. **Dimensional Media**: 3D models, animations, etc.

### Components of Multimedia DBMS:

- **Media Data**: Actual data representing an object.
- **Media Format Data**: Information on format (e.g., resolution, sampling rate).
- **Media Keyword Data**: Descriptive data (e.g., date, time, place of recording).
- **Media Feature Data**: Content-related data (e.g., colors, textures, shapes).

### Types of Multimedia Applications:

- **Repository Applications**: Store large amounts of multimedia data and metadata for retrieval (e.g., satellite images, scanned documents).
- **Presentation Applications**: Deliver multimedia subject to temporal constraints for optimal viewing (e.g., real-time video/audio).
- **Collaborative Work**: Merging multimedia data for teamwork (e.g., healthcare networks).

### Challenges of Multimedia Databases:

- **Modelling**: Difficulty integrating multimedia with traditional database retrieval techniques.
- **Design**: Complex physical, logical, and conceptual designs due to multiple data formats (JPEG, PNG, MPEG, etc.).
- **Storage**: Managing large objects, compression, and buffering of multimedia files.
- **Performance**: High processing time and bandwidth requirements for video/audio playback.
- **Query and Retrieval**: Need efficient methods to formulate, execute, and optimize multimedia queries.

### Applications of Multimedia Databases:

- **Document and Record Management**: Storing detailed records (e.g., insurance claims).
- **Knowledge Dissemination**: Resources for learning (e.g., electronic books).
- **Education and Training**: Multimedia-based learning tools (e.g., digital libraries).
- **Marketing, Advertising, Retailing**: Virtual tours, promotions, etc.
- **Real-Time Control and Monitoring**: Multimedia presentations for task monitoring (e.g., manufacturing control).

### Key Issues to Address:

- **Large Object Support**: Storing large multimedia objects (gigabytes of data).
- **Data Delivery**: Steady-rate delivery for continuous media (e.g., audio, video).
- **Similarity-Based Retrieval**: Queries based on similarity (e.g., fingerprint databases), requiring specialized index structures.

This summary highlights the components, challenges, applications, and issues related to multimedia databases.
